    Bi-directional link is formed between AP1 and GW

    Then:
    Agent must return a "Link metric response" (0x0006) which contains:
    - A "1905 transmitter link metric" TLV with AP1's local interface MAC address
    and GW's interface MAC address
    - A "1905 receiver link metric" TLV with AP1's local interface MAC address
