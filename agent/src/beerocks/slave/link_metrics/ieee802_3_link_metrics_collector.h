     * @brief Gets link metrics information.

     * Gets link metrics associated to the link between given local interface and a neighbor's
     * interface whose MAC address is 'neighbor_interface_address'.
     *
     * Note that metrics are associated to a link and not to an interface. For Ethernet interfaces
     * and in Linux though, it is not possible to obtain per link stats: in Linux is easy to check
     * how many packets were received by "eth0" *in total*, but it is not trivial to find out how
     * many packets were received by "eth0" *from each neighbor*. For the sake of simplicity this
     * implementation just reports the overall per-interface stats (thus ignoring the
     * 'neighbor_interface_address' parameter).
     *
     * @param[in] local_interface_name Name of the local interface.
     * @param[in] neighbor_interface_address MAC address at the other end of the link (this MAC
     * address belongs to a neighbor's interface.
     * @param[out] link_metrics Link metrics information.
     *
     * @return True on success and false otherwise.
