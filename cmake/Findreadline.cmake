    # <...>/usr/include/c++/6.4.0/cstdlib:75:25: fatal error: stdlib.h: No such file or directory
    # This happens since cmake is generating the include flags with -isystem instead of -I. Similar issue 
    # observed and discussed inin https://github.com/OpenLightingProject/ola/pull/1126 but they fix it in their build system

    # For now - simply do not set this property for none linux platforms - in UGW and RDKB we already have usr/include included
